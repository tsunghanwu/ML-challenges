# ML Challenges

## [Fraud Detection](https://github.com/tsunghanwu/ML-challenges/blob/master/Fraud/fraud%20detection.ipynb)

Company XYZ is an e-commerce site that sells hand-made clothes. You have to build a model that predicts whether a user has a high probability of using the site to perform some illegal activity or not. This is a super common task for data scientists.

You only have information about the user first transaction on the site and based on that you have to make your classification ("fraud/no fraud").

These are the tasks you are asked to do:

> * For each user, determine their country based on the numeric IP address.
> * Build a model to predict whether an activity is fraudulent or not. Explain how different assumptions about the cost of false positives vs false negatives would impact the model.
> * How would you explain how the model is making the predictions? Not from a mathematical perspective but from a user perspective. What kinds of users are more likely to be classified as at risk? What are their characteristics?

## [Ad Analysis](https://github.com/tsunghanwu/ML-challenges/blob/master/Ad/ad%20analysis.ipynb)

Company XYZ is a food delivery company. Like pretty much any other site, in order to get customers, they have been relying significantly on online ads, such as those you see on Google or Facebook.

At the moment, they are running 40 different ad campaigns and want you to help them understand their performance.

Specifically, you are asked to:

> * If you had to identify the 5 best ad groups, which ones would they be? Which metric did you choose to identify the best ad groups? Why? Explain the pros of your metric as well as the possible cons. From a business perspective, choosing that metric imples youâ€™re focusing on what?
> * For each group, predict how many ads will be shown on Dec, 15 (assume each ad group keeps following its trend).
> * Cluster ads into 3 groups: the ones whose avg_cost_per_click is going up, the ones whose avg_cost_per_click is flat and the ones whose avg_cost_per_click is going down
